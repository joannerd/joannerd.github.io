      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a musician turned programmer, and I love the art of learning and practicing new things. I received my Bachelor of Music from Boston Conservatory, where I focused on contemporary percussion music and the theory/history of classical music. Even as a musician, I've always been fascinated by technology - the first time I played around with code was in middle school, where I got really excited about being able to manipulate my own blog design. I've also always loved being part of a team. Collaborating with others always made me look forward to spending time on work and practice.
      </p>

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        In the last year of my music degree, I took a class about VR/AR development. I realized I hadnâ€™t explored programming like how I did when I was younger. My peers and the group projects of the class sparked inspiration in me. The class made me realize I want to spend my life learning and collaborating with hardworking people. I was deeply inspired by the innovative mindset and collaborative nature of my peers - I've been diving into software development ever since.
